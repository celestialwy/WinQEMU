WinQEMU is a Windows native version of QEMU. It ports the source code of QEMU to Visual C++. Consequently, it decouple the compilation of QEMU with the POSIX build environment.
So far, qemu 0.10.1/0.10.2/0.10.5 have been ported successfully. qemu 2.5.1 port is not yet completed.
Thanks a lot for Fabrice Bellard's great work on QEMU!
